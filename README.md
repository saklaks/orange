# The Fatal Lozenge, By Edward Gorey

An Apparition of her lover She recognizes with dismay;
and later on she will discover that he himself had died today.


The Effigy, got up with clothing 
Abstracted from the victim's room
Is raised aloft to cheers of loathing 
Before it meets a flaming doom


The Magnate waits upon the pavement
For his enormous limousine
And ponders further child-enslavement
And other projects still more mean.
