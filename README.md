# The Fatal Lozenge, By Edward Gorey

An Apparition of her lover She recognizes with dismay;
and later on she will discover that he himself had died today.

The Nun is fearfully bedevilled:
She runs about and moans and shrieks;
Her flesh is bruised, her clothes dishevelled:
She's been like this for weeks and weeks.  

The Proctor buys a pupil ices,
  And hopes the boy will not resist
When he attempts to practise vices
  Few people even know exist.  

The Quarry, fleeing from the outing,
  Sinks panting in the reeds and mud;
And Hearkens to the distant shouting
  That tells him they are out for blood.  

The Zouave used to war and battle
Would sooner take a life than not:
It scarcely has begun to prattle
When he impales the hapless tot.
